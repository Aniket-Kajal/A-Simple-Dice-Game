# A-Simple-Dice-Game

It is just a simple game where two dice are rolled simultaneously and assigned to two different players
and the player with the higher number wins the round and can be played again just by refreshing it.

** The main Objective of building this game was to practice beginner-level JavaScript like generating random numbers
which can have further use in high-level websites like (refer: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/lots-of-ways-to-use-math-random-in-javascript/"> Math.randon function</a>) 
as well as getting some practice in DOM manipulation like setAttributes and innerHTML. **

Changes can be made in the HTML, CSS and JavaScript file here to change the page according to your need.
